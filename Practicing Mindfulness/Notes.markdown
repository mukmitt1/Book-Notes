    * **Being fully Present**: you may have to coax the mind back to present moment repeatedly as you practice
    * **Seeing clearly**: understood as a recognition of the experience you ar having. when pain arises, you are able to identify it as pain. when anxiety is present,  you recognize it as anxiety. You are cultivating the wisdom to see what you are experiencing in present moment.
    * **Letting go of judgment**: Your mind labeling something good or bad, right or wrong, positive or negative. You can let go such value judgments. ACcept what is present in the mind including any feeling of liking or disliking

Whether the experience you have is easy or difficult,  the energy and effortyou bring it to it can remain unchanged. This way you learning to move through difficult situations with balanced and stability
