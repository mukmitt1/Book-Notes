## The Seven Spiritual laws of success

### Introduction
* It could also be called The Seven Spiritual Laws of Life because nature uses same principles to create everything in material existence - things we can see, hear, smell, taste or touch
* When this knowledge is incorporated in our consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited wealth with efforless ease 
* Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progessive realization of worthy goals
* Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease
* Succes is not just talking about material wealth
* Success also includes good health, energy and enthusiasm for life, relationships, creative freedom, emotional and psychological stabilities and piece of mind
* Success is a journey not destination
* Law is the process by which unmanifest becomes the manifest, observer becomes observed, dreamer manifests the dream
* All of the creation, everything that exist in physical world, is the result of the unmanifest transforming itself to the manifest

### 1. Law of Pure Potentiality or Law of Unity


* Law is based on the fact thar We are, in our essential state, pure consciousness
* Law is the process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest
* Pure consciousness is pure potentiality, it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity 
* Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy
* Other attribute of consciousness are pure knowledge, infine silence, perfect balance, invincibility, simplicity and bliss
* Self referral : our internal reference point is our own spirit and not the objects of our experience. fearless, no control or struggle for approval
  * soul is completely free of fear, control and approval
  * Immune to criticism
  * Humble and feels superior to non one  
* Object-refferal (fear based): influenced by objects outside the self which includes situations, circumstances, people & things
  * we are constantly seeking the approval of others
  * Our thinking and our behavior are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore fear based
  * we also feel an intense need to control things
  * we feel an intense need for external power
* Ego is your self image; it is social mask; It is the role you are playing  
* Power based on object referral is false power. Ego based power only exist as long as object of reference is there
  * If you are president of country or chairman of corporation or you have lot of money, power goes with title. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the power
* Self power is permanent. Because it is based on the knowledge of self
* we can apply law of potentiality through daily practice of 
  *  **silence** : means periodically withdrawing from  activity of speech, watching tv, radio,/ rading a book. without silennce, this creates turbulence in your internal dialogue. Inititally it is difficult and the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience pure potentiality
  *  **meditation**: Ideally 30 min morning, 30 min evening. You will learn pure silence and awareness. Be still
  *  **non-judgement**: constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you are evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create lot of turbulence  in internal dialogue
  *  **spending time in nature**: when you do other, you can start spending time with nature

### 2. The Law of Giving

* Also called Law of receiving because the universe operates through dynamic exchange
* Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with the body of the universe
* Your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos
* Every relationship is one of give and take
* Move you give, more you will receive
* Return is directly proportional to giving when it is unconditional and from the heart
* Relationship is one of give & take.
* Every seed is the promise of thousands of forest. Seed must not be hoarded. It must give intelligence to the fertile ground
* If you want joy, give joy to others; if you want love, learn to give love
* If you want attention & appreciation, learn to give attention & appreciation
* if you want materially affluence, help others tio become materially affluent
* If you want to be blessed with all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good thing in life
* Even thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer has the power to affect others
* we are bundle of thought in a thinking universe. Thought has the power to transform
* Best way to put the law of giving into operation - whenever you contact with anyone, you will give them something. It does not have to be material things; could be a flower, compliment, or a prayer; gift of caring, attention, affection, appreciation and love are most precious gifts.
* when you meet someone, silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness, joy and laughter. this kind of silent is very powerful
* Never to go anyone's house without bringing them a gift. you can bring a flower, note or a card, compliment. you can bring a prayer.
* Appy this
  * wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will being them a gift. Gift may be a compliment, a flower or a prayer.I will bring the process of circulating joy, wealth and  affulence in my life and others
  * Today I will gracefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gift of nature, sunlight and sound of birds singing or spring showers or first snow of winter. I will open to receiving from others. It can be material gifts, money, a complement or a prayer
  * I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving life's most precious gifts: gift of caring affections, appreciations and love. Each time I will meet someone, i will silently wish them happiness, joy and laughter

### 3. The Law of "Karma" or Cause And Effect

* Karma is both action  and consequences of that action. It is cause and effect simultaneously
* Karma is energy, which in itself is neither good nor bad; these are just the labels people choose to attach to it
* The energy created by an action has to be returned: “As yea sow so shall yea reap.” It cannot be avoided.
* Everyone has heard the happiness "What you sow is what you reap". If we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the seeds of happiness.
* Karma implies the action of conscious choice-making. You & I are essentially infinite choice makers. 
* Some of thes choices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously
* Best way to choose karmic law is to becomes consciosly aware of the choices we make in every moment
* Every thing happening at this time is a result of choices we make in every moment.
* If I insult you, you most likely make the choice of being offended.
* If I were to pay you a complement, you most likely make the choice of being pleased or flatered. It is still a choice.
* I could offend you or insult you, you could make the choice of not being offended.
* When you make any choice - you can ask yourself 2 things - What are the consequences of these choice that I'm making?  Will these choiuce that I'm making now bring happiness to me and to those around me?
* All those choice you select, it will result in form of behavior that is called spontaneous right action.
* Universal help us if we select the choice. Your body experience 2 kind of sensation: sensation of comfort and sensatation of discomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention and ask your body, "If I make the choice, what happens?"
* Most of the response coming from heart. It does not have win-lose orientation.
* what about past karma?  3 choices you can do about past karma
  * **pay karmic debts**: Most people choose to do that - unconsciously. of course.  Sometimes there's a lot of suffering  involved in the payment of those debts.  But law of karma says no debt  in the universe ever goes unpaid
  * **transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable experience**: This is interesting process in which you ask yourself,as you are paying karmic debt, "What can I learn from the experience? Why is this happening and what is the message that the universe is giving to me? How Can I make the experience useful to my fellow human beings?"  example if you break your leg while playing football, you can ask, "what can i learn from this experience? what is the message universe is giving me?" perhaps the message is you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body next time. Also How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings? you may write a book about playing football safely or you may design a specialshow or leg support that prevent injury. This way, while paying karmic debt, you convert adversity to benefit that may bring wealth and fullfuilment. this is the transmutation of your karma to positive experience. 
  * **Transcend it**:  When you perform an action, it creates a memory, which in turn generates a desire, which leads you to perform another action. For example: You take your first yoga class (action), then you know what happens in a yoga class (memory), and if you enjoyed the class, you decide to go back the following week (desire), and that following week you turn up again with your mat (action).Actions, memories, and desires are the Karmic software that run your life. The subtle energy created by your actions is stored within your memories and desires and is activated—sometimes immediately, but more often at some future time. To use the earlier example, you took the yoga class and then forgot about it until months later when you’re walking through town and notice a yoga studio. You remember your past experience, which triggers the desire to take another class. 
* You constantly create Karma from your actions, thoughts, words, from the actions of others under your control, from your attitudes, expectations, and lifestyle
* You create Karma from the intended actions you perform consciously and also from actions done unconsciously from ignorance.
* Apply the law of karma
  * whenever i make a choice, i will ask myself 2 questions "what are the consequences of this choice", "will this choice bring fulfillment and happiness to me also to those who are affected by this choice"
  * I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or discomfort. if choices feels comfortable, i will proceed otherwise i will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision. this guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and all those around me.
  * today i will witness the choices i make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of these choices, i will bring them to my conscious awareness.


### 4. The Law of Least Effort

* Principle of least action, of no resistence. Also called principle of harmony & love
* when we learn from nature, we easily fulfill our desires.
* grass does not try to grow, it just grows. Fish don't try to swim, they jusy swim. Flowers don't try to bloom, they bloom, Bird don't try to fly, they fly. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of sun to shine, it id human nature to make our dreams manifest into physical form, easily & effortlessly.
* In vedic science, this principle is known as the principle of economy of effort or do less and accomplish more. Ultimately you come to the state where you do nothing and accomplish everything. commonly called a mirracle is actually an expression of the Law of Least Effort.
* when you are in harmony with nature, you are established in the knowledge of your true self
* Least effort is expanded when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held togther by energy of love.   
* when you seek power and control over other people, you waste energy.
* when you seek money or power for the sake of ego, you spend energy chasing the illusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment.
* When you seek money for personal gain only. you cut off the flow of energy to yourself and interfere woth the expression of nature intelligence
* when your action are motivated by love, there is no waste of energy. infect your energy multiplies and accumlates and the surplus  energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything you want, including unlimited wealth.
* you can think of your physical body as device for controlling energy. It can generate, store and expend energy, and if you create in efficiemt way, then you can create any amount of wealth. Ego consumes greatest amount of energy.
* When internal reference point is the ego, when you seek power and  control over other people or seek approval from others. you spend your energy in a wasteful way.
* When internal reference point is sprit, you are immune to criticism and unfearful of any challange
* 3 components of the Law of least effort:. 
  * **1. Acceptance**: Today I will accept people situations, circumstances and events as they occur.  Means I will know that "this moment is as it should be" because whole universe is at it should be. when you are struggle against this moment, you are struggling against the whole universe. this means acceptance of this moment is total & complete You acceptance things as they are, not as you wish. You can wish for things for future but this moment you have accept things as they are.
  * When you frustrated or upset by a person or situation, remember you are not reacting to the person or situation, but to your feeling about the person or the situation. When you recognize and understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and to change it.
  * **2. Responsibility**: Not blaming anything or anyone for your situation including yourself. Having accepted this circumstances, this event, this problem, responsibilities then means the ability to have a creative responseto the situation as it is now. All problem contains the seeds of opportunity,and this awareness allows you to take the moment and transform it into better situation. You will start considerinhg problem as opportunity. There is hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your own evolution.
  * **Defenselessness**: You have relinquished the need to convince or persuade others of your point of view. Someone told, past is history, furure is mystery and this moment is gift. Thats why this moment is called "present". Make a commitment to follow the path of no resistence. I will remain open to all point of view and not be rigidly attached to any one of them.


### 5. Law of Intension and Desire

* Energy and information exist everywhere in nature. Even at quantum field level .
* Quantum field is influenced by intension & desire.
* Flower, rainbow, tree. blade of grass, human body when broken down to essential components, are energy and information
* WHole universe, in its essential nature is the moment of energy and information
* Only different between human and tree is the informational and energy content of your respective bodies.
* In the scheme of nature, human is priviledge species. We have a nervous system that is capable of becoming aware of energy and informational content of localized field
* We experience this field subjectively as our thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires. memories, drivers and beleifs. This same field is experienced objectively as the physical body and through that body, we experience this field as the world. 
* Your body is not separate from the bpdy of the universe. You are like a wave, wiggle
* Nervous system is aware of information and energy of its own quantum field. you can consciously change the energy and information content of your own quantum mechanical body and therefore influence the energy and information content of extended body - your environment, your world
* Conscious change is brought about by the 2 qualities inherent in consciousnessi -  attention and intention. Attention energies, intention transform
* whatever you put your attention on will grow stronger in your life. whatever you take your attention away from dis-integrate, disappear
* Intention trigger transformation of energy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment
* Quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome intended. this is because intention in fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.
* Infinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time event, all at the same time
* we see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass, every apple blossom, every cell of our body
* Through your intent, you can command the law of nature to fulfillment your dreams and desire.
* Intention is real power behind desire. Intention is powerful because intent is desire without attachement to outcome. Desire alone is weak because desire is most people is attention with outcome.
* Intent is for the future but your attention is in the present. Because future is creation in the present. You must accept the present as it is.
* you should never struggle againt the present
* Learn to harness the power of intention, and you create anything you desire,
* 5 steps for fulfilling your desires,  intention generates its own power:
  * 1. Slip into gap. Means center yourself in that silent space between thoughts, to go into the silence
  * 2. Established in that state of being, release your intentions and desires. In gap, there is no thought, these is no intention but as you come out of the gap - at that junction between the gap and thought, you introduce the intention
  * 3. Remain in the state of self refferral. Not to look at yourselgf through the eye of the world or allow yourself to be influenced by the opinions and critisms of others. Keep your desires to yourself
  * 4. Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. It means enjoy every moment in the journey of your life even we don;t know the outcome.
  * Let the uinverse handle the details
* How to Applying
  * 1. Make a list of desires. carry the list with me whereever i go. I will look at the list before I go silence or meditation. Look at it before go to sleep. Look at it when i wake up in the morning.
  * 2. release list of desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting when things don't seem to go my way, there is a reason
  * 3. i will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. i will accept the present as it is and manifest the future through my deepest most cherished intentions and desires.  
* Outsider example
* For example, take two people who hate their jobs. Let's call them Steve and John.
  * Steve is unhappy, and he spends his time lamenting about how awful things are and how he wished it was different. If one of his co-workers does something to upset him (which happens quite often) he gets angry and complains about how she should do things differently. He spends a great deal of his time wishing and daydreaming of a better job.
  * John is also unhappy. He also dreams of a better job, but he doesn't spend all day daydreaming. Instead, he focuses on researching other job opportunities, and he enrolls in a night class to improve his "marketability." John's co-workers also often upset him, but instead of wishing they were different, he uses it as fuel to be more productive in his job search
* Steve is clearly putting his attention on the future. Daydreaming and wishing don't accomplish anything. At the same time, his complaining is indicative of the fact that he is trying to change things he cannot. His intention is in the present.
* John has a much healthier approach. While his intention is in the future ("I will get a new job soon.") his attention is on the present ("What can I do now to get a new job?").Who do you think is going to get a new job first? 
* It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that in this example Steve is more negative and John is more positive. This balance between intention and attention is one of the key things that sets positive people apart from negative people.

### 6. Law of Detachment

* Law says that in order to aquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish your attachment to it
* Does not mean give up the intention to create your desire
* you don't give up the intention and desire, you give up your attachment to your result
* The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result, combing one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time.you will have that which you desire
* Detachment is based on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true self.
* Attachment is based on fear and insecurity
* Everything else is a symbol - cars, house, bank notes, clothes, planes etc. Symbol is come and go.
* Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of territory. It creates anxiety; its ends up making you feel hollow and empty inside because you exchange youself for the symbol of yourself.
* Attachment comes from poverty consciosness because attachement is always to symbols
* Detachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness because with detachment there is freedom to create and also have joymen and laughter. 
* without detachmenmt we are prisioners of helplessness, hopelessness, quiet desperation and seriousness
* People are constsantly seeking secuity and seeing security is very ephemeral thing
* Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity.  i.e. if i have X million dollars then I'll be secure. Then i will be financially indepemdemt and i will retire.But it never happens
* Security never comes from security alone
* Sesrch for secuity is an illusion
* Search for security and certainty is actually an attachment to the known. But known is our past
* Uncertainty on the other hand is the fertile ground pf pure creativity and freedom. Uncertainity means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence.
* The unknown is the field of all possibilities
* Applying the law
  * I will commit myself to detachment.I will allow myself & those around me the freedom to be as they are.I will not rigidly impose my idea how things should be. I will not force solution on problems, thereby creating new problems. i will participate in everything with detached involvement
  * Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingradients of my experience.in my willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out ofthe problem. Uncertain is my part of freedom
  * I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur when i remain open to an infinity of all possibilities, i will experience all the fun, adventure, magic & mystery of life.  


### 7. Law of Dharma or Purpose in life

* Dharma in sanskrit is purpose in life
* According to this law, you have a unique talent and unique way of expressing it.
* There is something that you can do better than anyone else in the world - for every unique talent and unique expression of thar talent, there are unique needs
* when unique needs are matchedwith your talents, that is the spark creates affluence
* if you start children from the beginning withhumanity this thought, you'd see the effect in their lives
* You have reason to be here and you have to find out
* Ask yourself  hou you can serve humanity and what your unique talents are
* 3 components of law of Dharma
  * Each of us here to discover our true self, to find out on our own that our true self is spritual. we are spritual beings that have occasional human experiences. 
  * Express unique talent.- you have one talent and when you do that thing, you lose track of time.
  * Service to Humanity : How can i help? instead of what's in it for me? The question "What's in it for me"is the internal dialogue of ego, "How can i help?" is internal dialogue of the spirit 
* Applying the law
  * Today i will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryo that lies deep within my soul. i will pay attention to the spirit within me that animates both my body and my mind.
  * i will make a list of unique talent. then i will list all the things that i love to do while expressing my unique talent. when i express my unique talent and use in the service of humanity, i lose track of time and create abundence in my life as well as other lives
  * I will ask myself "Jow can i serve?" or "how can i help"? the answer will help me to serve my fellow human beings with love
