## The Seven Spiritual laws of success

### Introduction
* It could also be called The Seven Spiritual Laws of Life because nature uses same principles to create everything in material existence - things we can see, hear, smell, taste or touch
* When this knowledge is incorporated in our consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited wealth with efforless ease 
* Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progessive realization of worthy goals
* Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease
* Succes is not just talking about material wealth
* Success also includes good health, energy and enthusiasm for life, relationships, creative freedom, emotional and psychological stabilities and piece of mind
* Success is a journey not destination
* Law is the process by which unmanifest becomes the manifest, observer becomes observed, dreamer manifests the dream
* All of the creation, everything that exist in physical world, is the result of the unmanifest transforming itself to the manifest

### 1. Law of Pure Potentiality or Law of Unity


* Law is based on the fact thar We are, in our essential state, pure consciousness
* Law is the process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest
* Pure consciousness is pure potentiality, it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity 
* Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy
* Other attribute of consciousness are pure knowledge, infine silence, perfect balance, invincibility, simplicity and bliss
* Self referral : our internal reference point is our own spirit and not the objects of our experience. fearless, no control or struggle for approval
  * soul is completely free of fear, control and approval
  * Immune to criticism
  * Humble and feels superior to non one  
* Object-refferal (fear based): influenced by objects outside the self which includes situations, circumstances, people & things
  * we are constantly seeking the approval of others
  * Our thinking and our behavior are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore fear based
  * we also feel an intense need to control things
  * we feel an intense need for external power
* Ego is your self image; it is social mask; It is the role you are playing  
* Power based on object referral is false power. Ego based power only exist as long as object of reference is there
  * If you are president of country or chairman of corporation or you have lot of money, power goes with title. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the power
* Self power is permanent. Because it is based on the knowledge of self
* we can apply law of potentiality through daily practice of 
  *  **silence** : means periodically withdrawing from  activity of speech, watching tv, radio,/ rading a book. without silennce, this creates turbulence in your internal dialogue. Inititally it is difficult and the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience pure potentiality
  *  **meditation**: Ideally 30 min morning, 30 min evening. You will learn pure silence and awareness. Be still
  *  **non-judgement**: constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you are evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create lot of turbulence  in internal dialogue
  *  **spending time in nature**: when you do other, you can start spending time with nature

### 2. The Law of Giving

* Also called Law of receiving because the universe operates through dynamic exchange
* Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with the body of the universe
* Your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos
* Every relationship is one of give and take
* Move you give, more you will receive
* Return is directly proportional to giving when it is unconditional and from the heart
* Relationship is one of give & take.
* Every seed is the promise of thousands of forest. Seed must not be hoarded. It must give intelligence to the fertile ground
* If you want joy, give joy to others; if you want love, learn to give love
* If you want attention & appreciation, learn to give attention & appreciation
* if you want materially affluence, help others tio become materially affluent
* If you want to be blessed with all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good thing in life
* Even thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer has the power to affect others
* we are bundle of thought in a thinking universe. Thought has the power to transform
* Best way to put the law of giving into operation - whenever you contact with anyone, you will give them something. It does not have to be material things; could be a flower, compliment, or a prayer; gift of caring, attention, affection, appreciation and love are most precious gifts.
* when you meet someone, silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness, joy and laughter. this kind of silent is very powerful
* Never to go anyone's house without bringing them a gift. you can bring a flower, note or a card, compliment. you can bring a prayer.
* Appy this
  * wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will being them a gift. Gift may be a compliment, a flower or a prayer.I will bring the process of circulating joy, wealth and  affulence in my life and others
  * Today I will gracefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gift of nature, sunlight and sound of birds singing or spring showers or first snow of winter. I will open to receiving from others. It can be material gifts, money, a complement or a prayer
  * I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving life's most precious gifts: gift of caring affections, appreciations and love. Each time I will meet someone, i will silently wish them happiness, joy and laughter

### 3. The Law of "Karma" or Cause And Effect

* Karma is both action  and consequences of that action. It is cause and effect simultaneously
* Karma is energy, which in itself is neither good nor bad; these are just the labels people choose to attach to it
* The energy created by an action has to be returned: “As yea sow so shall yea reap.” It cannot be avoided.
* Everyone has heard the happiness "What you sow is what you reap". If we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the seeds of happiness.
* Karma implies the action of conscious choice-making. You & I are essentially infinite choice makers. 
* Some of thes choices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously
* Best way to choose karmic law is to becomes consciosly aware of the choices we make in every moment
* Every thing happening at this time is a result of choices we make in every moment.
* If I insult you, you most likely make the choice of being offended.
* If I were to pay you a complement, you most likely make the choice of being pleased or flatered. It is still a choice.
* I could offend you or insult you, you could make the choice of not being offended.
* When you make any choice - you can ask yourself 2 things - What are the consequences of these choice that I'm making?  Will these choiuce that I'm making now bring happiness to me and to those around me?
* All those choice you select, it will result in form of behavior that is called spontaneous right action.
* Universal help us if we select the choice. Your body experience 2 kind of sensation: sensation of comfort and sensatation of discomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention and ask your body, "If I make the choice, what happens?"
* Most of the response coming from heart. It does not have win-lose orientation.
* what about past karma?  3 choices you can do about past karma
  * **pay karmic debts**: Most people choose to do that - unconsciously. of course.  Sometimes there's a lot of suffering  involved in the payment of those debts.  But law of karma says no debt  in the universe ever goes unpaid
  * **transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable experience**: This is interesting process in which you ask yourself,as you are paying karmic debt, "What can I learn from the experience? Why is this happening and what is the message that the universe is giving to me? How Can I make the experience useful to my fellow human beings?"  example if you break your leg while playing football, you can ask, "what can i learn from this experience? what is the message universe is giving me?" perhaps the message is you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body next time. Also How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings? you may write a book about playing football safely or you may design a specialshow or leg support that prevent injury. This way, while paying karmic debt, you convert adversity to benefit that may bring wealth and fullfuilment. this is the transmutation of your karma to positive experience. 
  * **Transcend it**:  When you perform an action, it creates a memory, which in turn generates a desire, which leads you to perform another action. For example: You take your first yoga class (action), then you know what happens in a yoga class (memory), and if you enjoyed the class, you decide to go back the following week (desire), and that following week you turn up again with your mat (action).Actions, memories, and desires are the Karmic software that run your life. The subtle energy created by your actions is stored within your memories and desires and is activated—sometimes immediately, but more often at some future time. To use the earlier example, you took the yoga class and then forgot about it until months later when you’re walking through town and notice a yoga studio. You remember your past experience, which triggers the desire to take another class. 
* You constantly create Karma from your actions, thoughts, words, from the actions of others under your control, from your attitudes, expectations, and lifestyle
* You create Karma from the intended actions you perform consciously and also from actions done unconsciously from ignorance.
* Apply the law of karma
  * whenever i make a choice, i will ask myself 2 questions "what are the consequences of this choice", "will this choice bring fulfillment and happiness to me also to those who are affected by this choice"
  * I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or discomfort. if choices feels comfortable, i will proceed otherwise i will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision. this guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and all those around me.
  * today i will witness the choices i make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of these choices, i will bring them to my conscious awareness.
