* Law is the process by which unmanifest becomes the manifest, observer becomes observed, dreamer manifests the dream
* All of the creation, everything that exist in physical world, is the result of the unmanifest transforming itself to the manifest

### 1. Law of Pure Potentiality or Law of Unity


* Law is based on the fact thar We are, in our essential state, pure consciousness
* Law is the process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest
* Pure consciousness is pure potentiality, it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity 
* Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy
* Other attribute of consciousness are pure knowledge, infine silence, perfect balance, invincibility, simplicity and bliss
* Self referral : our internal reference point is our own spirit and not the objects of our experience. fearless, no control or struggle for approval
  * soul is completely free of fear, control and approval
  * Immune to criticism
  * Humble and feels superior to non one  
* Object-refferal (fear based): influenced by objects outside the self which includes situations, circumstances, people & things
  * we are constantly seeking the approval of others
  * Our thinking and our behavior are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore fear based
  * we also feel an intense need to control things
  * we feel an intense need for external power
* Ego is your self image; it is social mask; It is the role you are playing  
* Power based on object referral is false power. Ego based power only exist as long as object of reference is there
  * If you are president of country or chairman of corporation or you have lot of money, power goes with title. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the power
* Self power is permanent. Because it is based on the knowledge of self
* we can apply law of potentiality through daily practice of 
  *  **silence** : means periodically withdrawing from  activity of speech, watching tv, radio,/ rading a book. without silennce, this creates turbulence in your internal dialogue. Inititally it is difficult and the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience pure potentiality
  *  **meditation**: Ideally 30 min morning, 30 min evening. You will learn pure silence and awareness. Be still
  *  **non-judgement**: constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you are evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create lot of turbulence  in internal dialogue
  *  **spending time in nature**: when you do other, you can start spending time with nature

### 2. The Law of Giving


* Also called Law of receiving because the universe operates through dynamic exchange
* Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with the body of the universe
* Your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos
* Every relationship is one of give and take
