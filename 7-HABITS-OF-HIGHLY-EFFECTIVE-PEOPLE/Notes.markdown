## The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

### Part One: Paradigms and Principles

#### Inside-Out

* Give our first energies to own character development before we focus on techniques or how to be more effective with others.
* Focus on roots
* In last 200 years, first 150 years focus on character ethics as the foundation of success i.e. integrity, humility, courage, justice, patience, simplicity, modesty. Talk about basic principles of effective leaving. People can enjoy true success
* Last 50 years are personality ethics which is superficial,  filled with social image consciousness, technique and quick fixes with social band-aid
* To change ourselves effectively, we first have to change our perceptions  i.e glass half empty or half full
* Personality ethic - how to "appear to be" rather than how to "actually be"
* Focus on value based motives
* People may have secondary (personality) greatness I.e social recognition for the talents - lack primary (character). Soon they will see in every long-term relationship (business, spouse, teenage child, friend)
* People may have lack of secondary strength (communication) but have character strength. Undoubtedly affect the quality of relationships as well. But the effects are still secondary
* Paradigm is the map you have in your mind. Maps are assumption of the way things are
* _We think we see the world as it is, when in fact we see the world as we are._ - Quote Stephen R covey
* Once you see things as they really are, you'll think, feel and act differently. 
* Paradigm is deeper than attitude and behavior
* Every one of 7 habits represent a principle
* Principle are natural laws, objective, factual, external and self-evident
* In captain/lighthouse story, lighthouse is principle- we don’t break them. We break ourselves against them.
* Are my value and habits in alignment with principles and natural laws
* Principles are not value. Gang of thief can share value but they are in violation of fundamental principles. Principles are territory. Values are map
* We experience everything through two mental maps: Realities, or the way things are, and values, or the way things should be.
* The influences of our lives, such as family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms, have all shaped our frame of reference, our paradigms, and our maps.
* We see the world not as it is, but as we are. When we describe the world, we describe ourselves, our perceptions, and our paradigms.
* The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, the more we can examine them, test them against reality, and listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a more objective view.
* To make a minor change in our lives, we can perhaps focus on our attitudes and behaviors. To make a significant, quantum change, we must focus on our basic paradigms.
* The Character Ethic is based on the fundamental idea that principles govern human effectiveness. These are natural laws in the human dimension, like Newton's law in the physical dimension.
* These natural laws are woven into the fabric of every civilized society throughout history and comprise the roots of every family and institution that has endured and prospered.
* These principles include fairness, integrity and honesty, dignity, service, quality or excellence.
* Principles are not values. We can hold values that are in violation of these fundamental principles. Principles are the territory, and values are the maps.
* The Personality Ethic promises quality of life without going through the natural process of work and growth that makes it possible. But this work is required for progress.
* Borrowing strength builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces dependence on external factors to get things done. It also builds weakness in the person forced to acquiesce, and weakness in the relationship.
* When a relationship is strained and the air is charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of judgment or rejection.
* To solve the problems created and interact within the Personality Ethic, we need a paradigm based on the principles that accurately describe the territory of effective human being and interacting.
* "Inside-out" means to start first with self; more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self, which is your paradigms, your character, and your motives.
* An outside in paradigm leads to people who feel victimized and immobilized, who focus on the weakness of others and the circumstances they feel are responsible for their own stagnant situation.



#### Habits -An overview

* Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or in-effectiveness
* Habits have tremendous gravity pull
* Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to, why to), skills (how to)  and desire (wants to). You need all 3
* Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm. The what to do & why. 
* Skill is how to do
* Desire is motivation
* Maturity Continuum from  dependence --> independent --> interdependence 
  * **In Dependent** -- u take care of me, u come through for me; U didn't come through , I blame u for the results
  * **Independence** - I can do it, I am responsible, I can choose. Do own effort. Impact Physically, mentally, emotionally, financially
  * **Interdependent** - we can do it (relationship with others)
* 7 habits are habits of effectiveness because they are based on principle
* As an interdependent person, you have the opportunity to share yourself deeply, meaningfully with others, and you have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings.
* Only independent people can choose to become interdependent. Dependent people cannot. They don't have the character to do it; they don't own enough of themselves.
* True effectiveness is a function of not just what is produced, but the producing asset of the capacity to produce. This is the P/PC balance, where P is the produced, and PC is for production capability.
* In P (Production)/PC (production capability) , P is what is produced (the golden egg), and PC is the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).
* 3 kinds of assets- physical, financial, human. For each type, there is not just an asset or produced good, but value in the production capability.
* You can't buy a person's heart, where his enthusiasm and loyalty is. You can't buy a person's mind, where his ingenuity and resourcefulness is.
* Maintaining a balance between the golden egg (production) and the health and welfare of the goose (production capability) is difficult, but it is the very essence of effectiveness.
* Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it is holy ground. There's no greater investment.

### Part Two: Private Victory

#### Habit 1: Be proactive

* If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from social mirror (opinion, perception, paradigm)- Our view of ourselves is the like the reflection in the crazy mirror room at the carnival. They are more projections rather reflection
* 3 social maps
  * Generic determinism  - ur grandparent did it to u. that’s why u have such a temper. 
  * Psychic determinism - ur parents did it to u. Your upbringing, ur childhood experience laid out
  * Environmental Determinism - ur boss or spouse is doing it to u.
* Each of above map is based on stimulus/response theorey
* Frankl quote "Between Stimulus and Response, man has the freedom to  choose"
* Within freedom to choose are those endowments that make us unique human. We can use self awareness, imagination (create in mind beyond reality)tg, conscience (inner awareness), independent will
* Frankl described an accurate self-map from which he began to develop the first and most basic habit of highly effective person, they habit of proactivity
* As human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our own decision not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to value
* Highly proactive people do not blame circumstances, conditions or conditioning for their behavior.
* Behavior is product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling
* Reactive people are often affected by physical environment. If weather is good, they feel good. If it not, it affects their attitude and performance.
* Proactive people can carry own weather with them. They are value driven - carefully thought about, selected and internalized values
* Reactive people also affected by their social environment. When people treat them well, they feel well. If not, people become defensive or protective
* Reactive people build emotions lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weakness of other people to control them
* Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by condition, by their environment
* Proactive people still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical social or psychological. But the responses is value based choices or response.
* Frankl suggest, 3 central values in life
  * Experiential - which happens to us.
  * Creative -  which we bring into existence
  * Attitudinal -  our response in different circumstances
* Highest of 3 is attitudinal
* Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious or aggressive
* Many people wait for something to happen or something to take care of them. But people who ends up with  good jobs are the proactive ones who are solution to the problem not problem themselves
* If any kid do same reactive approach we usually say,  use your R and I (Resourcefulness and initiatives)
* Resourceful employees are patient, creative, and confident, and they build strong professional networks, take initiative, and are always learning. 
* Resourceful employees can find solutions with a minimal number of resources, which is beneficial for every company in any industry.
* It take initiative to create the P/PC Balance of effectiveness in your life. It take initiative to develop the 7 habits
* Reactive vs Proactive language
* Love is value and feeling is fruit of love. You can actualized through loving actions.
* Proactive people subordinate feelings to values
* The Circle of Concern contains all of our concerns. Proactive people focus their efforts on the embedded Circle of Influence, which are the things they can do something about.
* Problems over which we have direct control are solved by working on our habits; problems with indirect control we solve by changing our methods of influence.
* It is much safer to say "I am not responsible." If you say "I am responsible," then you might also have to say "I am irresponsible."
* The Circle of Concern is filled with statements with "have," like "If I only had..." The Circle of Influence is filled with "be," like "I can be more patient" or "I can be wise."
* Mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can't recall them, we can't undo them, and we can't control the consequences that came as a result.
* It is important to immediately admit and correct our mistakes so that they have no power over the next moment and we are empowered again.
* The commitments we make to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those commitments, is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity.
* Making promises, setting goals, and being true to them is the essence of our growth. It builds the strength of character that makes possible every other positive thing in our lives.
* 3 kinds of problem
  * Direct control (Problem involving our own behavior)- solving by working on our habits. These are private victories of Habits 1,2 and 3
  * Indirect control (Problem involving other people behavior) - by changing out method of influence. These are public victories
  * No Control
* One way to determine which circle our concerns is in is to distinguish between the have and the be
  * If only I had a boss wasn't such a dictator ..
  * If only I had a more patient husband…
  * I'll be happy when I have my house paid off
* Circle of influence filled with be - I can be more patient, be wise, be loving
  * Various ways to work in circle of influence - better listener, loving marriage partner, better student, dedicreactively ated employee 


* **30 days test**
  * Full day listen to yoru language and language of other people around you. How long listen reactive phase I can't, If only, I Have to
  * Identify an experience based on past experience you are behaving reactively 
    * Based on circle of Infleunce, How could you response proactively. 
    * Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your mind, picturing yourself responding in proactive manner. 
    * Remind yourself the gap between stimulus and response. 
    * Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose
  * Select a problem from your work or personal life trhat is frustrating you
    * Determine if it is direct, indirect or no control problem
    * Indentify the first step you can take in circle of influence to solve it and then take next step
  *  Be aware of change in Circle of Infleuence    


#### Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

* The most fundamental application of this habit is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as the frame of reference or criterion by which everything else is examined
  * Each part of your life - today's behavior, tomorrow's behavior, next week, next month behavior - can be examined in context of whole or what really matters most to you.
  * This ensures that each day does not violate the criteria you define as most important, and that each day contributes meaningfully to the vision you have of your life as a whole.
* How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do whats really matter most
* If a ladder is not leaning against the right wall, then every step we take up it just takes us to the wrong place faster.
  * we may be very busy, very efficient, but we will be truely effective only when we begin the the end in mind 
* "Begin with the end in mind" is based on the principle that all things are created twice: There's a mental creation first, and a physical creation second.
* We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the second creation of other people's agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits.  
* Management is the bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership is a top-line focus: What do I want to accomplish?
* If industries do not monitor their environment, including their own work teams, and exercise the creative leadership to head in the right direction, then no amount of management expertise can save them.
* Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success. Leadership determines whether the leader is leaning against the right wall
* Leadership is even more lacking in our personal lives. We're into managing with efficiency, setting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values.
* Leader is the one who climb the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation, and yells "wrong Jungle"
* Leadership is hard because we are often caught in management paradigm
* Parents are also trapped in management pradigm, thinking of control, efficiency and rules instead of direction, purpose and family feeling
* Use your imagination and creativity to write new scripts for yourself that are more effective, more congruent with our values and the principles that give our values meaning.
* By writing a new script, you can live out of your imagination instead of your memory, and tie yourself to your limitless potential instead of your limiting past. You can become your own first creator.
* Once you have a sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity; you have vision and values to direct your life.
* What is at the center of our life, or our Circle of Influence, will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power.
* Security is your sense of worth, guidance is your source of direction, wisdom is your perspective, and power is your capacity to act.
* If we are marriage centered, then we become highly dependent on the relationship with our spouse, and may be dependent on the person with whom we are in conflict.
* If we are family centered, then our need to be popular with the children may override the importance of a long-term investment in our children's growth and development.
* If we are money centered, then we are vulnerable to all the external factors that will affect that net worth.
* If we are work centered, then our fundamental identity comes from our work, and our security is vulnerable to anything that happens to prevent us from continuing in it.
* If we are possession centered, then we feel inferior when in the presence of someone with greater net worth, and feel superior when in the presence of someone with lesser net worth. There is no constancy.
* If we are pleasure centered, we take too much undisciplined leisure time, in which we continually take a course of least resistance that gradually wastes our life.
* If we are friend centered, then the social mirror becomes the source of our four life-support factors, and we depend on the fluctuating moods, attitudes, and behaviors of others.
* If we are church centered, image or appearance can become a person's dominant consideration, leading to hypocrisy that undermines personal security and intrinsic worth.
* If we are self centered, then we accept but never give. But paying attention to the development of the self gives context for dramatic increase in the four life-support factors.
* The ideal is to create one clear center from which you consistently derive a high degree of security, guidance, wisdom, and power, empowering your proactivity and giving congruency and harmony to every part of your life.
* Centering our lives on correct principles creates a solid foundation for the four life-support factors. Correct principles do not change; we can depend on them.
* Principle-centered living yields a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or by circumstances or environmental influences.
* The only real limitation of principle-centered living is the natural consequences of the principles themselves.
* Looking at things through a paradigm of correct principles yields an outlook that is dramatically different than what you see through any other centered paradigm.
* Because you have a high degree of security, guidance, wisdom, and power that flows from a solid, unchanging core, you have the foundation of a highly proactive and highly effective life.
* To seek some abstract meaning to our lives in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our own first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people.
* Until you accept the idea that you are responsible, or that you are the programmer, you won't invest in writing the program.
* The more we are able to draw upon our right brain capacity, the more fully we can project a holistic picture of what we want to do and be in life.
* If you're proactive, you don't need to wait for circumstances or other people to create perspective-expanding experiences. You can consciously create your own.
* Almost all world-class athletes and other peak performers are visualizers. They see it, they feel it, they experience it before they actually do it.
* Affirmation and visualization are forms of programming; we must not submit ourselves to any programming that is not in harmony with our basic center or anything other than correct principles.
* When people work to become effective in their life, they don't think broadly enough. They lose the sense of proportion and balance necessary to effective living.
* Identify your various roles, and then think about long-term goals for each one. They should extend a mission statement that is based on correct principles, reflecting your deepest values, unique talent, and sense of mission.
* Just identifying the various areas in your life and two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead gives you an overall perspective and sense of direction.
* Mission statements for families or for organizations are best when everyone comes together with mutual respect, expressing different views, and works together to create something greater than any one person could do.



#### Habit 3: Put First Things Forst

* Habit 1 says that you are the creator. Habit 2 is the first or mental creation; it is the deep contact with our basic paradigms and values and the vision of what we can become.
* Habit 3 is the second or physical creation. It is the fulfillment, the actualization, and the natural emergence of the first two habits.
* Practicing Habit 3 requires effective self-management. This is the breaking down, analysis, sequencing, specific application, time-bound left-brain aspect of self government.
* Empowerment comes from learning how to use this great endowment of independent will in the decisions that we make every day.
* The degree to which we have developed our independent will is measured by our personal integrity, which is fundamentally the value that we place on ourselves.
* Successful people do things that failures don't like to do. This requires independent will to be a function of your values rather than a function of the impulse or desire of any given moment.
* The efficiency focus of modern time management creates expectations that clash with the opportunities to develop rich personal relationships, meet human needs, and enjoy spontaneous moments.
* Urgent matters require immediate attention and are usually visible. Important matters have to do with results, and contribute to your mission or your high priority goals.
* If we do not practice Habit 2, then we don't have a clear idea of what is important, of the results that we desire in our lives, and we are diverted to responding to the urgent.
* People who focus on only urgent matters, important or not, lead irresponsible lives. Focusing on things that are important but not urgent, or Quadrant II, is the heart of effective personal management.
* Crises are important and urgent matters. Cultivating proactivity to focus on Quadrant II matters, such as building relationships, planning, and maintenance will lessen them.
* To make time for Quadrant II, you cannot steal time from crises; instead you must say no to urgent and unimportant, or not urgent and unimportant matters.
* The essence of important time and life management is to organize and execute around balanced priorities.
* How you spend your time is a function of your priorities. To spend time on Quadrant II tasks requires a principle center and a personal mission that are planted in your heart and mind.
* Identify your roles and select your goals, and then translate each goal to a specific day of the week, either as a priority item or, even better, as a specific appointment.
* Your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance.
* Reviewing your schedule each morning puts you in touch with the value-based decisions you made as you organized the week as well as unanticipated factors that may have come up.
* Living the program is a function of our independent will, integrity, and commitment to our correct principles and deepest values, which give meaning and context to our goals, schedules, and life.
* You can't simply think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with people and efficiency with things.
* Frustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social mirror rather than our own values and priorities.
* Delegating to others is perhaps the single most powerful high-leverage activity there is. It enables both individuals and organizations to grow.
* Gopher delegation uses one-on-one supervision of methods. The user still thinks like a producer and is responsible for the results. This does not scale.
* Stewardship delegation focuses on results instead of methods, giving people a choice of methods and makes them responsible for the results. It does scale.
* With stewardship delegation, you must communicate the desired results without focusing on methods, guidelines while identifying paths to failure, resources available, standards for evaluating results, and consequences from the evaluation.
* Trust is the highest form of human motivation and brings out the very best in people, but you may have to train people so that their competency can rise to the level of trust.
* Stewardship delegation applies to any kind of person or situation: you simply ramp up or down the desired results, resources, accountability interviews, and consequences.

#### Paradigms of Interdependence

* Effective interdependence can only be built on  a foundation of true independence
* self mastery & self-discipline are the foundation of good relationship with others
* Most important ingradients we put into relationship is not what we say or do, but what we are. If our actions come from personality Ethic rather than from character Ethics, others will sense that duplicity
* In an interdependence situation, golden eggs are effectiveness and wonderful synergy,the result created by open communication and postive interaction with others. Just to take care of goose, we need to create and care for relationships.
* An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor that describe the amount of trust . breaking one is wuthats been built up in a relationship
* 6 major deposit that builds the emotional bank account:
* Understanding the individual: may be going for a walk, eat icecream together, working on common project. Principle of making what is important to the other person as important to you as other person is to you.
* Attending the little things: little kindness, courtesies so important for deposit
* keeping commitment: keeping promise is a major deposit. breaking promise is major withdrawal
* clarifying expectation: 
* showing personal integrity: such as loyal to those who are not present, 
* Apologizing sincerely when you make a withdrawl:
* Laws of love & laws of life: when we truly love others without condition, with strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their essential worth, identity and integrity
* P Problems are PC oppertunities

#### Habit 4: Think win/win

* 6 paradigms of human interactions
  * Win/Win: All parties feel good. Win/Win may be use as 3rd alternative - not your way or my way
  * Win/Lose: I get my ways, you didn't get yours. Win/lose people are prone to use position, power, credential, positions, personalities to get their way. win/lose is low trust situation
  * Lose/Win:worst than win/lose because it has no standards, no vision, no expectations. win/lose people love lose/win people 
  * Lose/Lose: when 2 win/lose people(stubborn, ego-invested, determined, individual interact) get together, result will be lose/lose
  * Win
  * No Deal or win/win 
* Think win/win is the habit of interpersonal leadership
* Effective interpersonal leadership requires vision, proactive initiative and the security, guidance,wisdom and the power that come from principle centered personal leadership
* win/win embraces 5 interdependent  dimensions of life
  * character
  * relationship
  * agreements
  * supportive systems
  * processes
* character is the foundation of win/win. 3 character traits essential to the win/win paradigm:
  * Integrity: Habit 1,2, 3 help us develop and maintain integrity. 
  * Maturity: the balance between courage and considerations. courage is providing golden egg. Consideration deals with longterm welfare of other staeholders
  * Abundance mentality: plenty out there for everybody   
* Relationship: we build and msintain win/win relationship. The trust, emotional bank account is the essense for win/win
