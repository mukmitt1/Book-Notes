## The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

### Part One: Paradigms and Principles

#### Inside-Out

* Give our first energies to own character development before we focus on techniques or how to be more effective with others.
* Focus on roots
* In last 200 years, first 150 years focus on character ethics as the foundation of success i.e. integrity, humility, courage, justice, patience, simplicity, modesty. Talk about basic principles of effective leaving. People can enjoy true success
* Last 50 years are personality ethics which is superficial,  filled with social image consciousness, technique and quick fixes with social band-aid
* To change ourselves effectively, we first have to change our perceptions  i.e glass half empty or half full
* Personality ethic - how to "appear to be" rather than how to "actually be"
* Focus on value based motives
* People may have secondary (personality) greatness I.e social recognition for the talents - lack primary (character). Soon they will see in every long-term relationship (business, spouse, teenage child, friend)
* People may have lack of secondary strength (communication) but have character strength. Undoubtedly affect the quality of relationships as well. But the effects are still secondary
* Paradigm is the map you have in your mind. Maps are assumption of the way things are
* _We think we see the world as it is, when in fact we see the world as we are._ - Quote Stephen R covey
* Once you see things as they really are, you'll think, feel and act differently. 
* Paradigm is deeper than attitude and behavior
* Every one of 7 habits represent a principle
* Principle are natural laws, objective, factual, external and self-evident
* In captain/lighthouse story, lighthouse is principle- we don’t break them. We break ourselves against them.
* Are my value and habits in alignment with principles and natural laws
* Principles are not value. Gang of thief can share value but they are in violation of fundamental principles. Principles are territory. Values are map
* We experience everything through two mental maps: Realities, or the way things are, and values, or the way things should be.
* The influences of our lives, such as family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms, have all shaped our frame of reference, our paradigms, and our maps.
* We see the world not as it is, but as we are. When we describe the world, we describe ourselves, our perceptions, and our paradigms.
* The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, the more we can examine them, test them against reality, and listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a more objective view.
* To make a minor change in our lives, we can perhaps focus on our attitudes and behaviors. To make a significant, quantum change, we must focus on our basic paradigms.
* The Character Ethic is based on the fundamental idea that principles govern human effectiveness. These are natural laws in the human dimension, like Newton's law in the physical dimension.
* These natural laws are woven into the fabric of every civilized society throughout history and comprise the roots of every family and institution that has endured and prospered.
* These principles include fairness, integrity and honesty, dignity, service, quality or excellence.
* Principles are not values. We can hold values that are in violation of these fundamental principles. Principles are the territory, and values are the maps.
* The Personality Ethic promises quality of life without going through the natural process of work and growth that makes it possible. But this work is required for progress.
* Borrowing strength builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces dependence on external factors to get things done. It also builds weakness in the person forced to acquiesce, and weakness in the relationship.
* When a relationship is strained and the air is charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of judgment or rejection.
* To solve the problems created and interact within the Personality Ethic, we need a paradigm based on the principles that accurately describe the territory of effective human being and interacting.
* "Inside-out" means to start first with self; more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self, which is your paradigms, your character, and your motives.
* An outside in paradigm leads to people who feel victimized and immobilized, who focus on the weakness of others and the circumstances they feel are responsible for their own stagnant situation.



#### Habits -An overview

* Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or in-effectiveness
* Habits have tremendous gravity pull
* Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to, why to), skills (how to)  and desire (wants to). You need all 3
* Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm. The what to do & why. 
* Skill is how to do
* Desire is motivation
* Maturity Continuum from  dependence --> independent --> interdependence 
  * **In Dependent** -- u take care of me, u come through for me; U didn't come through , I blame u for the results
  * **Independence** - I can do it, I am responsible, I can choose. Do own effort. Impact Physically, mentally, emotionally, financially
  * **Interdependent** - we can do it (relationship with others)
* 7 habits are habits of effectiveness because they are based on principle
* As an interdependent person, you have the opportunity to share yourself deeply, meaningfully with others, and you have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings.
* Only independent people can choose to become interdependent. Dependent people cannot. They don't have the character to do it; they don't own enough of themselves.
* True effectiveness is a function of not just what is produced, but the producing asset of the capacity to produce. This is the P/PC balance, where P is the produced, and PC is for production capability.
* In P (Production)/PC (production capability) , P is what is produced (the golden egg), and PC is the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).
* 3 kinds of assets- physical, financial, human. For each type, there is not just an asset or produced good, but value in the production capability.
* You can't buy a person's heart, where his enthusiasm and loyalty is. You can't buy a person's mind, where his ingenuity and resourcefulness is.
* Maintaining a balance between the golden egg (production) and the health and welfare of the goose (production capability) is difficult, but it is the very essence of effectiveness.
* Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it is holy ground. There's no greater investment.

### Part Two: Private Victory

#### Habit 1: Be proactive

* If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from social mirror (opinion, perception, paradigm)- Our view of ourselves is the like the reflection in the crazy mirror room at the carnival. They are more projections rather reflection
* 3 social maps
  * Generic determinism  - ur grandparent did it to u. that’s why u have such a temper. 
  * Psychic determinism - ur parents did it to u. Your upbringing, ur childhood experience laid out
  * Environmental Determinism - ur boss or spouse is doing it to u.
* Each of above map is based on stimulus/response theorey
* Frankl quote "Between Stimulus and Response, man has the freedom to  choose"
* Within freedom to choose are those endowments that make us unique human. We can use self awareness, imagination (create in mind beyond reality)tg, conscience (inner awareness), independent will
* Frankl described an accurate self-map from which he began to develop the first and most basic habit of highly effective person, they habit of proactivity
* As human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our own decision not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to value
* Highly proactive people do not blame circumstances, conditions or conditioning for their behavior.
* Behavior is product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling
* Reactive people are often affected by physical environment. If weather is good, they feel good. If it not, it affects their attitude and performance.
* Proactive people can carry own weather with them. They are value driven - carefully thought about, selected and internalized values
* Reactive people also affected by their social environment. When people treat them well, they feel well. If not, people become defensive or protective
* Reactive people build emotions lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weakness of other people to control them
* Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by condition, by their environment
* Proactive people still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical social or psychological. But the responses is value based choices or response.
* Frankl suggest, 3 central values in life
  * Experiential - which happens to us.
  * Creative -  which we bring into existence
  * Attitudinal -  our response in different circumstances
* Highest of 3 is attitudinal
* Taking initiative does not mean being pushy, obnoxious or aggressive
* Many people wait for something to happen or something to take care of them. But people who ends up with  good jobs are the proactive ones who are solution to the problem not problem themselves
* If any kid do same reactive approach we usually say,  use your R and I (Resourcefulness and initiatives)
* Resourceful employees are patient, creative, and confident, and they build strong professional networks, take initiative, and are always learning. 
* Resourceful employees can find solutions with a minimal number of resources, which is beneficial for every company in any industry.
* It take initiative to create the P/PC Balance of effectiveness in your life. It take initiative to develop the 7 habits
* Reactive vs Proactive language
* Love is value and feeling is fruit of love. You can actualized through loving actions.
* Proactive people subordinate feelings to values
* The Circle of Concern contains all of our concerns. Proactive people focus their efforts on the embedded Circle of Influence, which are the things they can do something about.
* Problems over which we have direct control are solved by working on our habits; problems with indirect control we solve by changing our methods of influence.
* It is much safer to say "I am not responsible." If you say "I am responsible," then you might also have to say "I am irresponsible."
* The Circle of Concern is filled with statements with "have," like "If I only had..." The Circle of Influence is filled with "be," like "I can be more patient" or "I can be wise."
* Mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can't recall them, we can't undo them, and we can't control the consequences that came as a result.
* It is important to immediately admit and correct our mistakes so that they have no power over the next moment and we are empowered again.
* The commitments we make to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those commitments, is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity.
* Making promises, setting goals, and being true to them is the essence of our growth. It builds the strength of character that makes possible every other positive thing in our lives.
* 3 kinds of problem
  * Direct control (Problem involving our own behavior)- solving by working on our habits. These are private victories of Habits 1,2 and 3
  * Indirect control (Problem involving other people behavior) - by changing out method of influence. These are public victories
  * No Control
* One way to determine which circle our concerns is in is to distinguish between the have and the be
  * If only I had a boss wasn't such a dictator ..
  * If only I had a more patient husband…
  * I'll be happy when I have my house paid off
* Circle of influence filled with be - I can be more patient, be wise, be loving
* Various ways to work in circle of influence - better listener, loving marriage partner, better student, dedicreactively ated employee 


* **30 days test**
  * Full day listen to yoru language and language of other people around you. How long listen reactive phase I can't, If only, I Have to
  * Identify an experience based on past experience you are behaving reactively 
    * Based on circle of Infleunce, How could you response proactively. 
    * Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your mind, picturing yourself responding in proactive manner. 
    * Remind yourself the gap between stimulus and response. 
    * Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose
  * Select a problem from your work or personal life trhat is frustrating you
    * Determine if it is direct, indirect or no control problem
    * Indentify the first step you can take in circle of influence to solve it and then take next step
  *  Be aware of change in Circle of Infleuence
