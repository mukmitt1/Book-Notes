## The Fundamentals : Why tiny changes make a big difference

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

* Small habits make a big difference
* same way as money multiplies through compound interest, the effect of your habits multiplies as you repeat them
* they seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous
* We make a few changes but the result never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into the previous routine
* unfortunately, slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. when we repeat 1% errors, day ny day , by replicating poor decision, duplicating tiny mistakes and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compounds into toxic results. 1% declines here and there, eventually leads to problem
* if you shift route of plane by 1 degree, imagine LAX to NY flights, just 3.5 degree south, you will be in DC
* Success is the product od daily habits, not once in lifetime transformation
* If you want to predict, where you will end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or losses, and see how life will change in 10-20 year down the line. Are you spending less than each month, are you making it to gym each week, are you reading the book and learning new each day. Tiny battles  are the one that define your future.
* Habits can compound for you or against you
  * **Productivity Compounds (Positive compounding)**:Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat in any given day but it counts for a lot over an entire career. Effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. More task you can handle without thinking, the more your brain free to focus on other areas.
  * **Knowledge Compounds (Positive compounding)**:Learning one new idea won't make you genius, but commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Each book you read, teaches something new but also opens different way of thinking about old ideas. 
  * **Relationships Compounds (Positive compounding)**: People reflect your behavior back to you. the more you help others, the more other wants to help yoy. Being little nicer in each interaction, can result in network of broad and strong connections over time.
  * **Stress Compounds (Negative compounding)**: Frustration of traffic jam, weights of parenting responsibilities, strain of high blood pressure. By themselves these commomn cause of stress is manageable. But when they persist for years, little stress compounds into serious health issues.
  * **Negative thoughts Compounds (Negative compounding)**: The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way, You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.
  * **Outrage Compounds (Negative compounding)**: Riots, protests and mass movements are rarely the result of single event.Instead of long series of microaggregations and daily aggavations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrages spreads like wildfires
