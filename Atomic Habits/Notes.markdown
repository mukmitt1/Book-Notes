## The Fundamentals : Why tiny changes make a big difference

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

* Small habits make a big difference
* same way as money multiplies through compound interest, the effect of your habits multiplies as you repeat them
* they seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous
* We make a few changes but the result never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into the previous routine
* unfortunately, slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. when we repeat 1% errors, day by day, by replicating poor decision, duplicating tiny mistakes and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compounds into toxic results. 1% declines here and there, eventually leads to problem
* if you shift route of plane by 1 degree, imagine LAX to NY flights, just 3.5 degree south, you will be in DC
* Success is the product of daily habits, not once in lifetime transformation
* If you want to predict, where you will end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or losses, and see how life will change in 10-20 year down the line. Are you spending less than each month, are you making it to gym each week, are you reading the book and learning new each day. Tiny battles  are the one that define your future.
* Habits can compound for you or against you
  * **Productivity Compounds (Positive compounding)**:Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat in any given day but it counts for a lot over an entire career. Effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. More task you can handle without thinking, the more your brain free to focus on other areas.
  * **Knowledge Compounds (Positive compounding)**:Learning one new idea won't make you genius, but commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Each book you read, teaches something new but also opens different way of thinking about old ideas. 
  * **Relationships Compounds (Positive compounding)**: People reflect your behavior back to you. the more you help others, the more other wants to help yoy. Being little nicer in each interaction, can result in network of broad and strong connections over time.
  * **Stress Compounds (Negative compounding)**: Frustration of traffic jam, weights of parenting responsibilities, strain of high blood pressure. By themselves these commomn cause of stress is manageable. But when they persist for years, little stress compounds into serious health issues.
  * **Negative thoughts Compounds (Negative compounding)**: The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way, You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.
  * **Outrage Compounds (Negative compounding)**: Riots, protests and mass movements are rarely the result of single event.Instead of long series of microaggregations and daily aggavations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrages spreads like wildfires
* Ice cube not melts on 26,27,28,29,30, 31 - No change, as soon as 32 degree - cube melt. Earlier one degree shift no difference but later huge difference. 
* Breakthrough moments are ofte nthe results of many previous actions 
* Cancer spends 80% of its life undectectable, then takes over the body in months
* Bambook not visible in 1st five years.It builds extensive root system underground before exploding 90 feets in six weeks
* Habits often appear no differences until you cross a critical threashold
* People makes small changes , fails to see tangible results, and decide to stop. In order to make a meaningful difference, habit need to persist long enough to break through this plateau called plateau of Latent potential
* If you find struggle with building new habit or break bad habit, it is not beacause you lost your ability of improve. It is often because you have not crossed the plateau of latent potential
* Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about and ince cube noyt melting when you heated from 26 to 31 degree. You work is not wasted but it is just being stored
* When you break Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. Outside world only see most dramatice event rather than all that preceded it.
* Similar to earth quake, 2 tectonic plates can grind each other for millions of year, tension slowly building all the whoile.
* All big things comes from small beginnings, Seeds of every habit is a single tiny decision. But as the decision is repeated, a bait sprout and grows stronger.
* Task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower, one day at a time.
* Forget about goals, focus on system instead.
* Usually we create goal like - Getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more, worrying less, spending more time with friends and family. 
* For many years I approached my habits too.  Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goal for grades, weights I wanted to lift in the gym. I succeed at a few but I failed a lot. At the end I realized that my results has nothing to do with the goals i set and everything to do with the systems i followed.
* System and Goals - Goal is about the results you wants to achieve, system are the process that lead to those results.
  * If you are a coach,  your goal is to win a trophy. your system is the way you recruit player, manage assistant coaches and conduct practices.
  * If you are a musician, you goal might be play new piece, your system is how you practice, how you tacle different measure  
* if you completely ignored your goals and focus only on your systems would you still succeed.  Answer is yes, you can succeed
* Goal in any sports is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to  spend the whole game starting at scorecard
* Goals are good for setting a direction, but system are best for making progess
* Probem 1: Winners/Losers have sane goal: All have same goal but it is a system of continous small improvements 
* Problem 2: Achieving a goal is only a momentry change: If you goal is to clean the room, you may achieve you goal by cleaning the room one time. You are left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treat symptom without addressing the cause.  Fix the input, output will fix automatically
* Problem 3: Goal restrict your happiness: The implicit assumption behind goal, once i reach my goal, i will be happy.It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one sceanario when there are many path to success. A System first provides the anti-dot. When you fall in love with the process rather than product, you don;t have to give yourself persmission to happy. If your system is running, you can happy at any time.
* Problem 4: Goals are at odds with long term progress: Many runner work hard for months but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. Race is no longer there to motivate them. That is reason people move to old habit. Purpose of setting goals to win the game. Purpose of building system is to continous playing the game.True longterm thinking is goal less thinking
* Focus on overall system rather than a single goal. Atomic habit refer to tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1% improvement
* Just like atom is building blocks of molecules. atomic habit is building blocks of remarkable results. Habits are like the atom of our lives.

### How your habit shape your identity (and vice versa)

* Why it is so easy to develop bad habits and so hard to form good ones?
* Habits like exercise, meditation, jounaling and cooking are resonable for 2 days and then become a hassle
* Ones your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever - especially the unwanted ones. Unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much tv, smoking etc difficult to break
* Changing habits because of 2 reasons:
  * 1. We try to change  the wrong things
  * 2. we try to change our habits in wrong way
* 3 levels change can occur (behavior change). 3 layers
  * 1. **Changing your outcomes**: Concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship
  * 2. **Changing your process**: Concerned with changing your habits and systems. Implementing new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, develop meditation practice
  * 3. **Changing your Identity**: concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self image, your judgement  about yourself & others. Most of the beleifs, assumptions and biases you hold are associated with this level.
* Outcomes are what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what your beleive.
* When it comes to building habits that last - When it comes to 1% improvements - the problem is not that 1 level is better or worse than another. ALl level of change are useful.  The problem is direction of change.
* Many People begin the process of changing their habits by focussing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits
* Alternate is to build **identity-based habits**.  With this approach, we start by focussing on who we wish to become.
* Example 2 people resisting a cigrette. When offered a smoke, 
  * first person "No thanks, I'm trying to quit" - Here person beleive, he is a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around same belief
  * Second person "No thanks, I am not a smoker" - This statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of former life, not their current one
* Most people don't even consider identity change when they set out to improve.
  * They just think "I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I strict to the diet, then I'll be skinny (Process). 
  * They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the belief that drives their actions
  * They never shift the way that look at themselves, and never realize that their old identify can sabotage their new plans for change. 
 * Behind every system of action is a system of beliefs. System of democracy is founded  on belief like freedom, majority rules and social equality. System of dictatorship has different belief like absolute authority and strict obedience.
 * Voting is behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs
 * Similar pattern exist whether we are discussing individuals, organizations or societies
 * There are set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits
 * Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last
   * You may want more money but if your identity is someone who consumes rather creates, then you'll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.
   * You may want better health, but if you continue to priorties comfort over accomplishment, you will be drawn to relaxing rather than training.
 * It is hard to change your habit, if you never change your underlying belief that led to past behavior. You have new goal and a new plan, but you haven't changed who you are.
 * Story of Brian Clark- He chewed fingernails. It started as a nervous habit when i was young. One day through mindful willpower alone, i managed to do it. Clark did something new. He asked his wife to scheduled manicure. His thought was, if I started paying to maintain my nails, i will not chew them.  It worked but not because of monetary reason. Manicure made his finger look too nice for the first time. He never chewed his nails after that. Ultimate reason of intrinsic motivation was habit become part of identity
 * Rather than saying i am type of person who want this, say "i am type of person who is this"
 * the more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habit associated with it.
 * If you like hair, you will develop all sorts of habits to maintain the habit associated withh it.
 * If you like the biceps, you will make sure never miss upper body workout
 * once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habit
 * True behavior change is identity change.Improvements are temp until they part of who you are
   * the goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader
   * the goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner
   * the goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is  become a musician
 *  progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continously edit your belief and upgrade/expand your identity\
 *  Your identity emerges out of your habit. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief learned and conditioned through experience
 *  Your habit embody your identity
    * When you make bed each day. you embody youe identity as organized person
    * When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person
    * when you train each day, you embody the identity of athletic person
   * the more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
   * How to change your identity is 2 step processes
     * 1. Decide the type of person you want to be
     * 2. prove it to yourself with small wins
   * The most effective way to change your habit is to focus not on what you want to achieve. but on who you wish to become 
     * I am the kind of teacher who stands up for his/her students
     * I am the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy they need.
     * I am kind of manager who advocates for his employee
     * i am kind of writer who is consitent and reliable
